See SCAD files for dimensions of components.

Adjust sizes to fit your needs/screw size/mount size/magnet size.

OpenSCAD model is pretty good at auto updating location of stuff.

Rotate RingSwitch_Mountable so little holes are on top for print.
Rotate _CordHolder so big hole is up/down. CordHolder is optional.

Wire is held in place by the contact screws themselves, so make sure they are the correct length. They should squish the wires when bottomed out.

Uses M6*2 magnets.
M4x8 screws (cap/mushroom head).
Pre-wired 3.5mm mono cord. https://amzn.to/3pfgZ44
